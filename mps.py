# Tc = Rc + Pc + Dc
# Tc – Total Cost
# Rc – Raw Material Cost (price of the raw material used to produce that piece)
# Pc – Production Cost (Cost to Produce the piece)
# Dc – Depreciation Cost (Cost of money invested in the piece)
# Dc = Rc x (Dd - Ad) x 1%
# Ad – Arrival Date – date the raw material arrived at the production line
# Dd – Dispatch Date – date final work-piece leaves the production line (unloaded on cell E)
# Pc = € 1 x Pt
# Pt – Total Production time (in seconds).
